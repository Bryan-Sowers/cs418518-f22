The thesis contends that Blake's metaphors,"", 'images, and symbols describe the creative process, and that his', 'poetry dramatizes and illustrates a conception of art. The thesis', ""stops short of criticizing Blake's axioms, but tries to discuss"", 'the inter-relation between ideas and themes and the symbols which', 'incorporate those ideas. Irony and paradox are seen throughout', ""to inform Blake's system of symbols and the way in which he uses"", 'a symbol, image, or metaphor.', 'In essence, then, the concern is with the ""creative theme""', ""in Blake's poetry and the symbols in which it is embodied."", 'The thesis is composed of ten chapters, divided into two', 'parts: the first part discusses ""the creative theme"" and the second', '""the symbols of the creative theme"". Part One is concerned mainly', ""with Blake's conception of the poet and his ideas about the nature"", 'of creative action. Blake believed that creativity originated with', 'the imagination, and that no creation could be performed without', 'the imagination. Furthermore, he appears to believe that only in', 'the imagination is there a reconciliation between the symbol and', 'that for which the symbol stands. Since a work of art in the broad-', 'est sense is a crystallization, art becomes for Blake the means by', 'which man realizes his creativity, his sense of identity, the quality', 'of his mind. The identity of the poet or the artist depends upon', 'the scope and intensity of his imagination. Part Two, which is the', ""main body of the thesis, is devoted to an examination of Blake's"", 'creative images and symbols, particularly as these appear in', 'Milton and Jerusalem; purpose is to provide a guide to the sym-', ""bolic figures in Blake's major poetry."", ""In discussing Blake's conception of the creative process, I"", 'have stressed certain themes. I argue that the creative process is', 'seen as a unifying action which integrates aspects of a fully ex-', ""perienced totality. Secondly, Blake's eternity of art would presup-"", 'pose an eternity of mind whose inward dialogue identifies word and', ""object. Thirdly, Blake's poet is one who achieves continual renewal"", 'through a revelation or vision of ""All that Exists"".

First, we find the', '""union-disunion"" myth which has as its symbolic focus the figure', 'of the ""cosmic man"" or ""fallen giant"". Essentially, this myth re-', ""verses Plato's allegory of the cave, since Blake deals not with an"", 'ascent from a shadowy world-womb but the descent into it. Secondly,', 'he exploits an ""Orc myth"", which interprets the tragic as well as', 'the cyclical nature of fallen existence. This myth portrays a', 'struggle between reason and desire, the tyrant and the rebel. Such', 'a ""dialectic"" spawns new theses which are the parents of antitheses.', 'Orc logic is Hegelian, and the final synthesis is always out of', 'sight. Thirdly, we observe the myth of the ""transforming', 'presence""', 'which has as its symbolic focus the figure of woman. Her nature is', 'twofold. In one aspect she is Vala-Rahab or Babylon, the Lamia,', 'the seductress or virgin-whore sans merci. In her other aspect,', 'she is Jerusalem, the emanation, the daughter of her own son. These', 'three patterns of myth portray the same experience from different', 'points of view.', ""All Blake's poetry is, like Jerusalem, quasi-critical. Crea-"", 'tion encompasses the totality of things--it is the circumference', 'towards which man must reach. Man must be like the peacock, eyed', 'all over (Jerusalem 98). The self is to be destroyed by an expan-', 'sion, not by shrinking. Man becomes all not by generalizing him-', 'self, but by particularizing himself.', 'The woman figure mirrors the state of the ego: the narrower', 'the ego, the more destructive is her power; the greater the ego,', 'the more creative her power.

When man is still-born, when his imagination ceases to', 'expand, ceases to find or fulfil itself, he moves from the state of', 'Orc, the unactualized potential, to the state of Urizen, the im-', 'potent potential.

Introduction', 'During the past sixteen years a major question of public policy', 'has revolved around the racial separation of students in the public', 'schools of the United States. Early interest in this issue focused', 'on the effects of legally enforced ""de jure"" segregation typical of', 'the Southern states. De jure segregation, however, was ruled uncon-', 'stitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States which concluded:', 'that in the field of public education the', 'doctrine of separate but equal has no place.', 'Separate educational facilities are inherently', 'unequal', 'Such segregation is a denial of', 'the protection of the laws. (Brown vs Board of', 'Education, Topeka, Kansas, 347 U.S. 483, 1954)', 'While this ruling made the intentional separation of students by race', 'illegal, it did not eliminate or even significantly reduce the actual', 'separation of students by race within our public school systems. It', 'did, however, help provide the basis for a shift in interest to the', 'effects of racial separation regardless of the reasons for that', 'separation.', ""Although, the Court's decision applied only to legally enforced"", 'segregation of students, the reasoning upon which it was based could', 'be applied with equal force to ""de facto"" segregation. As early as', '1953 it was suggested that the effects of segregation either de facto', 'or de jure were likely to be highly similar for black children (Milner,', '1953). Peter Drucker recognized this point and in 1957 predicted that', 'it was in the urban north that the real issue of racial segregation', 'would be met.', 'Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

To be sure, half of our Negro population', 'still lives in the South, but the proportion of', 'young Negroes of school age still in the South is', 'already much less; and even fewer Negro children', 'live in rural areas where integration will be', 'fought the hardest.', 'Increasingly therefore, race relations will become', 'problems of the industrial city, and especially of', 'the Northern industrial city.

Since that time this issue has managed', 'continually to attract attention and to generate controversy.', ""Thus during the mid 1960's demands for the elimination of de facto"", 'segregation increased and were recognized by public officials.
